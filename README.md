# Anime API

## Overview

This project sends a GET request to an Anime API (<https://docs.api.jikan.moe/>) and depending on what button is selected, will return either a random Anime or Manga.

## Technology

Vite was used to create the React JavaScript project. React Query was used for sending the request to the API. Tailwind CSS was used for styling.

## Improvements

I am planning on adding more functionality to the project, so that you can also access the Top Anime/Manga, then click on them to access further information.

I also intend to improve the styling, and provide more information from the random Anime/Manga that is returned.
